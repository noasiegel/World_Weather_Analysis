# World_Weather_Analysis

## Brief Description of Project

For this project we utilized various API tools to help Jack with PlanMyTrip app. We used weather description data to enhance the app so users understand weather when planning their trips. Users are actually able to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, and the code will return potential travel destinataions and nearby hotels based on said input temperature preferences. From there, a user can choose four cities fro the list to create an itinerary. By using the Google Maps Directions API, we were able to create a travel route between the four cities and add a marker layer map for easy visualizations and travel details.
